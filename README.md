## Overview of World Weather Analysis
PlanMyTrip, a company specializing in internet-related services for the hotel & lodging industry, is looking to set up a search interface for customers to be able to narrow down travel destinations according to their weather preferences. This analysis will help collect and present data for travel destinations and hotel recommendations across the world, based on the customer's preferred weather criteria. Furthermore, it will help the customer customize a travel plan accordingly based on their selections. 

## Process & Results
First, this analysis generates a large set of random locations and their current weather information.
